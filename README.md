# SpaceShooter

This is a game prototype made following the Udemy course part 1  https://www.udemy.com/course/o-guia-definitivo-para-desenvolvimento-de-jogos-com... but with lots of changes, including custom models, enemies and a boss fight!

It is a simple space shooter. Doubt you can finish it XD. Enjoy!
